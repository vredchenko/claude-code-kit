Initialize a new Python project with modern tooling:

1. Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
2. Set up a virtual environment using uv, poetry, or venv
3. Configure ruff for linting and formatting
4. Set up pytest for testing
5. Create a basic project structure (src/, tests/)
6. Add a .gitignore for Python projects

Ask the user about their preferred package manager and project structure.
