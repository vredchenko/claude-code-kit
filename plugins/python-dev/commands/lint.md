Run linting and formatting checks on Python code:

1. Detect available linters (ruff, flake8, pylint, mypy)
2. Run linting checks on the codebase
3. Report issues found with file locations
4. Offer to auto-fix fixable issues
5. Run type checking if mypy is configured

Help maintain code quality through automated checks.
