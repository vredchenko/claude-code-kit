Initialize Playwright in the current project:

1. Install Playwright and its dependencies
2. Create playwright.config.ts with sensible defaults
3. Set up the tests/ directory structure
4. Install browsers if not present
5. Create an example test file

Ask the user about their testing preferences (browsers, base URL, etc.).
