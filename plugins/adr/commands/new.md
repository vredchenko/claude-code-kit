Create a new Architecture Decision Record (ADR):

1. Determine the next ADR number from existing records
2. Ask for the decision title and context
3. Create the ADR file in docs/adr/ or adr/ directory
4. Use the standard ADR template with sections:
   - Title
   - Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
   - Context
   - Decision
   - Consequences

Guide the user through filling in each section.
