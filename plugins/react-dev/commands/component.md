Generate a new React component:

1. Ask for the component name and type (functional/class)
2. Determine the project's component conventions (folder structure, styling)
3. Create the component file with proper TypeScript types
4. Create associated files (styles, tests, stories) based on project patterns
5. Export the component appropriately

Follow the existing patterns in the codebase for consistency.
