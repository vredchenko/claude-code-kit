Generate a GitHub Actions workflow for dependency vulnerability scanning:

1. Ask the user about their project:
   - Project type (JavaScript/npm, Bun, Python, multi-language, container)
   - Preferred scanner(s)
   - Whether to fail builds on vulnerabilities
   - Minimum severity threshold (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Whether to upload results to GitHub Security tab

2. Generate the appropriate workflow file(s) in `.github/workflows/`

## Example Workflows

        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.sarif }}
          category: 'grype'
```

3. Create the workflow file in the project's `.github/workflows/` directory

4. Explain the workflow configuration and how to customize it

5. Suggest enabling GitHub's Dependabot as a complementary security measure
