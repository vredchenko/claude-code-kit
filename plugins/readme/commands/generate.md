Analyze the current project structure and generate a comprehensive README.md file. Include:

1. Project title and description based on package.json, pyproject.toml, or other manifest files
2. Installation instructions appropriate for the project type
3. Usage examples based on the main entry points
4. Configuration options if applicable
5. License information if available

Ask the user before overwriting an existing README.md.
