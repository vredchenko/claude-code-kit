Analyze the project and set up the local development environment:

1. Detect the project type (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
2. Install dependencies using the appropriate package manager
3. Set up environment variables from .env.example if present
4. Initialize any required databases or services
5. Verify the setup by running a health check or basic command

Report any issues found and suggest fixes.
