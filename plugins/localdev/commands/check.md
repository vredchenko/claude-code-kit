Check the local development environment for common issues:

1. Verify all required dependencies are installed
2. Check that environment variables are properly configured
3. Validate that required services (databases, caches) are running
4. Ensure proper file permissions
5. Check for outdated dependencies

Provide a summary of the environment health and any recommended actions.
