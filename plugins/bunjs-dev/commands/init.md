Initialize a new Bun.js project in the current directory. Set up:

1. Run `bun init` if no package.json exists
2. Configure TypeScript with appropriate tsconfig.json for Bun
3. Set up a basic project structure with src/ directory
4. Add common dev dependencies (prettier, eslint if requested)
5. Create a basic .gitignore for Bun projects

Ask the user about their preferences for the project setup.
