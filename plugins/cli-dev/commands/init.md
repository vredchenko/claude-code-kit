Initialize a new CLI application project:

1. Ask for the CLI name and target language (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
2. Set up the project structure appropriate for CLI apps
3. Configure argument parsing library (commander, argparse, cobra, clap)
4. Create a basic command structure
5. Set up build and distribution configuration

Create a solid foundation for a command-line application.
