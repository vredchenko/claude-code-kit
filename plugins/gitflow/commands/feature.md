Create a new feature branch following gitflow conventions:

1. Ensure the working directory is clean
2. Fetch latest changes from origin
3. Create a new branch from develop (or main if no develop branch)
4. Use the naming convention: feature/<feature-name>

Ask the user for the feature name and create the branch.
