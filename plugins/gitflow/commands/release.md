Prepare a release branch following gitflow conventions:

1. Ensure the working directory is clean
2. Determine the next version number (ask user or detect from commits)
3. Create release branch from develop
4. Update version numbers in relevant files
5. Create a draft changelog if applicable

Guide the user through the release preparation process.
