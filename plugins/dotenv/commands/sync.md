Synchronize environment variable files:

1. Compare .env with .env.example
2. Identify missing variables in either file
3. Report any variables in .env not documented in .env.example
4. Offer to add missing variables to .env.example (without values)
5. Check for potentially sensitive values that shouldn't be committed

Help keep environment configuration in sync.
