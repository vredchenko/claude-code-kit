Check environment variable configuration:

1. Verify .env file exists and is readable
2. Compare with .env.example to find missing variables
3. Validate required variables are set
4. Check for empty or placeholder values
5. Warn about any .env files that might be committed to git

Ensure the environment is properly configured.
